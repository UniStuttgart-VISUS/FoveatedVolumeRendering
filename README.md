This is a simple volume raycaster based on OpenCL.
It can display volumes in dat-raw format and uses the Qt framework for the GUI. 

To compile/run the code you need an OpenCL 1.2 capable device and drivers.
A reasonably new Qt version is required (tested with Qt 5.9.0) as well as a compiler capable of C++14 (tested with gcc 7.1.0).
