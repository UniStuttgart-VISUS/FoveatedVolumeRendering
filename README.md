# Description #

An interactive, cross platform volume raycaster based on the OpenCL compute API.
It features early ray termination, image order empty space skipping, local illumination, and various gradient based shading techniques.
It can display volume (timeseries) data sets in .dat/.raw format and uses the [Qt](https://www.qt.io) framework for the GUI. 

# Setup and build #

To compile the code you need:

*  An OpenCL 1.2 capable device and drivers/libraries with image support. If you are compiling under Windows, make sure to link against the OpenCL/OpenGL libraries provided by your vendor. See the description at [StreamHPC](https://streamhpc.com/blog/2015-03-16/how-to-install-opencl-on-windows/) for details on how to set up Visual Studio. 
*  A reasonably new Qt version is required, tested with Qt 5.9.x and Qt 5.10. Under Windows, make sure to copy the required Qt .dlls in the directory next to your executable.  
*  A compiler capable of C++14, tested with gcc 7.1.0 and Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC v141).

Use CMake to build the volume rasycaster:ascent

```
git clone https://theVall@bitbucket.org/theVall/basicvolumeraycaster.git
cd basicvolumeraycaster
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/install
make -j `nproc`
```
Make sure to replace the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH with the path to your Qt install directory, e.g. ```/home/username/Qt/5.11.2/gcc_64/```
