Perception-driven Accelerated Rendering (M.Weier et. Al):

Abstract:
digital images with more complexity, realism
trend to more pixels per display, more bits per pixel, more views per pixel (stereo, multi-view, ..)
also higher refresh rates are wanted
-> technical challenges, limited compute power
human visual system (hvs) has limitiations
-> highest possible visual quality not always necessary
-> methods to exploit these limitations to decrease computational efforts while maintaining visual experience
